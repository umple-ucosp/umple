##Introduction

This is the main project for various Umple subprojects and components.

Umple is a model-oriented programming technology. It allows developers to embed modelling concepts (e.g. associations, state machines), patterns and other abstractions in traditional code, and vice versa. It generates high quality code for Java, C++ and PhP (and can be embedded in or embed these), as well as diagrams, metrics and many other artifacts.

The project homepage is located at http://umple.org/

##Development
Umple is developed in itself, guaranteeing robustness, the most recent version of the compiler must be used to compile itself. See the wiki for development setup.

Development follows a model-driven, test-driven, agile, continuous-integration process. Umple is hosted currently on Github at http://code.umple.org. It was first released in 2007, and the master was on Google Code from 2011 to 2015.

Umple has been largely developed as a research project at the University of Ottawa, Canada, by numerous PhD and masters students, Many undergraduates from across Canada and the USA have also contributed. See the license file for the list of contributors.

  * Architecture: http://architecture.umple.org

Umple is continuously tested and build at the University of Ottawa using CruiseControl; see http://cc.umple.org . It is also built on Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/) and Appveyor (https://appveyor.com/).
